## Martian: A Self Organized Social Network Based On Emails
### Thunderbird-Addon

Imagine we want to send our bank account numbers and their passwords to our relatives. What application can we use? Can we guarantee that the service provider will not **monitor or leak our information**?

You might say that the application you are using is safe according to the service providers. Are they telling you they use end-to-end encryption or some other "fancy" techniques? Then try to answer this question, **"What if they add backdoors in their applications?"**

Moreover, you might ask whether it is safe if we use voice messages instead of texts. **If you are able to edit texts with speech recognition techniques, the service providers are able to do so, too.**

Since we cannot get full access to the source code of current social platforms and instant message applications, a fully open-sourced social platform may be the only method to protect our information.

There were many open source projects that tried to offer an alternative to the mainstream social platforms. But as far as we know, none of them succeeded.

Generally speaking, there are two categories of such open source methods. The first category generates a unique ID with the application and uses this ID to identify the user. Besides some technical issues, the main problem of this category of methods is that it is difficult to add friends since the ID is isolate with other contact information of the user. The second category of methods uses Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Besides some technical issues, one big problem is that there isn't many reliable free XMPP servers. **These methods are all great in terms of technology, but a successful application is not only about technology.**

Having reviewed many of the existing products and considered the problem of feasibility, we proposed a **_Self-Organized Social Network Based on Emails_**.

Email service is one of the most widely used free services on the Internet. It is even possible for an individual user to establish her/his own email server. In addition, Email service provides an extra layer in the communication process, which allows users to edit texts by themselves. Taking advantage of this extra layer, we may encode the content of our email and thus protecting our private information.

From another perspective, our application can be viewed as an Email client. By showing nothing but emails relevant to our application, it filters out many trash Emails and makes the email reading experience better.

We view our application as a complementary of mainstream social platforms, an introduction to more technically advanced distributed communication solutions and a trade-off between technology and easy accessibility.

**Other than developing uses, this application is not allowed to be spread or used in P.R. China. Any usage of this application should obey local laws and regulations. Users should take full responsibility of messages conveyed by this application. All kinds of inappropriate messages are highly discouraged.**
